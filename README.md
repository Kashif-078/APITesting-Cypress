# APITesting-Cypress
This code demonstrates API testing in Cypress, covering common HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE and makes requests to the JSONPlaceholder API. Here's a brief description you can use for the README file:

**API Testing in Cypress**
This repository showcases examples of API testing using Cypress, a JavaScript end-to-end testing framework. The code demonstrates how to perform HTTP requests and assert the expected responses. The JSONPlaceholder API is used as the target for the API testing scenarios.

**HTTP Methods Covered**
GET Request: Examples of GET requests are included, fetching a list of posts and retrieving a specific post by ID.
POST Request: The code demonstrates a POST request, creating a new post by sending data to the JSONPlaceholder API.
PUT Request: A PUT request is made to update an existing post by specifying the post ID and providing the updated data.
DELETE Request: The code includes a DELETE request to remove a specific post by ID from the JSONPlaceholder API.

**Running the Tests**
To run the API tests, ensure that you have Cypress installed. Clone this repository and navigate to the project directory. Then, execute the following command:
npx cypress run
This will run the Cypress tests, making the API requests and validating the responses.

**Feel free to customize the code and explore additional API testing scenarios using Cypress.**
